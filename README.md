# Vendus SDK for PHP

The Vendus SDK for PHP is a opensource library that enables PHP developers to integrate with [Vendus API](https://www.vendus.pt/ws/), made available by [Vendus](https://www.vendus.pt/), an online invoicing software. 

By using this API, users can easily integrate third party software with Vendus.

## Sign up for a Vendus account
Before starting, please signup for a [Vendus](https://www.vendus.pt/) account, if you haven't already, and retrieve your *API KEY*.

## Minimum requirements
To run the SDK, your system will need to meet some minimum requirements, including having **PHP >= 5.4**.

We highly recommend having it compiled with the cURL extension and cURL 7.16.2+ compiled with a TLS backend (e.g., NSS or OpenSSL).

## Install the SDK
Using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) is the recommended way to install the Vendus SDK for PHP. 

The SDK is available via [Packagist](http://packagist.org) under the [`vendus/vendus-sdk-php`](https://packagist.org/packages/vendus/vendus-sdk-php) package. 

Run this command:
```sh
composer require vendus/vendus-sdk-php
```

## Using the SDK
The best way to become familiar with how to use the SDK is to read the [Documentation](./docs/). 

We also have some [Examples](./docs/examples/) that may help you become familiar with all the concepts.

Basically, you instantiate `Vendus\Api` and then, while specifying an endpoind, you issue one of the methods available: `list`, `get`, `create` or `update`.

A basic example on how to get a list of documents:

```php
<?php

require 'vendor/autoload.php';

$apiKey    = 'PUT_YOUR_API_KEY_HERE';
$vendus    = new Vendus\Api($apiKey);
$documents = $vendus->documents->list();

?>
```
