## Minimum requirements
To run the SDK, your system will need to meet some minimum requirements, including having **PHP >= 5.4**.
We highly recommend having it compiled with the cURL extension and cURL 7.16.2+ compiled with a TLS backend (e.g., NSS or OpenSSL).

## Install the SDK
Using [Composer](http://getcomposer.org) is the recommended way to install the Vendus SDK for PHP. 
The SDK is available via [Packagist](http://packagist.org) under the [`vendus/vendus-sdk-php`](https://packagist.org/packages/vendus/vendus-sdk-php) package. 
Run this command:
```sh
composer require vendus/vendus-sdk-php
```

## Using the SDK
The best way to become familiar with how to use the SDK is to read the [Documentation](./docs/). We also have some [Examples](./docs/examples/) ttat will help you become familiar with the basic concepts.

## Disclaimer

This SDK is currenly being developed and should not be used in production. It will be ready in a couple of days.
